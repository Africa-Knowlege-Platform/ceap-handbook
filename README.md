# Clean Energy Access Prioritiser 



## Introduction

The Clean Energy Access Prioritiser (CEAP) is an open-source and open-access decision-support tool designed to identify priority areas for clean energy interventions and investments. The spatial planning tool allows users to evaluate clean energy projects with a multi-sectoral approach, including environmental, socio-economic, technical, and political aspects. 
This web-based tool allows for multi-criteria selections helping identifying priority areas (hot and cold spots) in real-time based on custom priorities. The automatic geo-processing capabilities encompass more than 30 variables, spanning aspects such as energy demand, environmental and social conditions.
The CEAP can be of interest to both institutional and private stakeholders in the energy sector, i.e. policymakers, international donors, governments, and philanthropic investors.
